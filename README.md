# Court-Case-Management-System
The term Court Case Management System (CCMS) refer to a subset of law practice management and cover a range of approaches and technologies
used by law firms and courts to leverage knowledge and methodologies for managing the life cycle of a case or matter more effectively.

There have been CCMS only from one perspective i.e, the Court's/Firm's perspective, so we came up with a similar management system from
client's perspective called way2CMS (case management system). This helps the client to manage the legal activities he/she has to go 
through all-in-one place.
The fundamental concept of the project is to come up with a web application where a user can hire a lawyer, check status of his/her 
case (if it exists) and also provide some basic information about laws and sections so that they get some idea about what they're 
dealing with.Along with all these features for the client, we also have a feature for the advocates to register themselves in our
web application in order to get hired by the potential clients. The advocates will be providing the invoice after they get hired.
